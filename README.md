Information on upgrading the Tektronix Tekmate 2402 and 2402A

Here you find a PDF document outlining how I upgraded my Tektronix Tekmate 2402A from its original 16MHz 80286 Ampro motherboard to a Versalogic VSBC-2 motherboard using a 133MHz 586 CPU.  It shows how I acommodated the differences between the pre-standardization Ampro EBX motherboard and the later standardized Versalogic board.  Additionally, I discuss how I brought the original Ampro LittleBoard/286 back to life before I replaced it with the Versalogic board.

To make it easy to find, here is a link to the PDF on the upgrade:

Because links on the internet are unreliable and subject to change or deletion, I have collected a number of useful items for the 2402/2402A here: manuals on the Ampro LittleBoard/296, and the Versalogic VSBC-2 board, as well as the now public domain Borland Turbo-C V3.0 that I used to do programming for the 2402, on the 2402.  If you are going to use a vintage computer it is probably best to use a programming environment that was designed FOR that hardware.

Additionally, I have included disk images for DOS 6.22 and a supplemental disk so you can have an appropriate operating system.  

I would have liked to include the manual for the 2402A as well, but it is larger than the 25MB file size limit.  So, here are two links to that manual (also Tektronix's copyright release):
