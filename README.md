# Upgrading-The-Tektronix-2402
Information on upgrading the Tektronix Telmate 2402 and 2402A

Here you wind a PDF document outlining how I upgraded my Tektronix Tekmate 2402A from its original 16MHz 80286 Ampro motherboard to a Versalogic VSBC-2 motherboard using a 133MHz 586 CPU.  It shows how I acommodated the differences between the pre-standardization Ampro EBX motherboard and the later standardized Versalogic board.  Additionally, I discuss how I brought the original Ampro LittleBoard/286 back to life before I replaced it with the Versalogic board.
